## About me
___
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. program at the [VLLAB](https://vllab.cau.ac.kr/) of Chung-Ang University's School of Computer Science and Engineering, under the guidance of Professor [Eunwoo Kim](https://vllab.cau.ac.kr/members/professor/). My research interests lie in the fields of deep learning and computer vision. Specifically, I have a strong interest in continual learning, robotics, and their applications.<br>
  

I am actively engaged in research within these areas and actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with individuals who share similar research interests, beyond the confines of these fields. If there are any possibilities for collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me at any time.
