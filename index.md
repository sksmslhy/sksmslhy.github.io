## About me
___
I am currently a Ph.D. student at [VLLAB](https://vllab.cau.ac.kr/), Chung-Ang University, advised by Prof. [Eunwoo Kim](https://vllab.cau.ac.kr/members/professor/). My research primarily focuses on deep learning and computer vision. Specifically, I have a strong interest in continual learning, robotics, and their applications.

I am dedicated to advancing research in these domains and strongly believe in the value of collaboration. I am always eager to connect with researchers from diverse backgrounds to exchange ideas or explore potential synergies. Please feel free to reach out to me for any discussions.
